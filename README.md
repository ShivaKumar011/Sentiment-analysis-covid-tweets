## Introduction
The Sentiment Analysis for COVID Tweets project aims to develop a classification model to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) based on tweets related to COVID-19. The goal is to analyze public opinion and emotions surrounding the pandemic. The algorithms used in this system include Multinomial Naive Bayes Classification, Random Forest Classification, and KNN Classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of 41,157 tweet records. It can be accessed in the provided Excel sheet [here](link_to_dataset_excel_sheet).

## Algorithms Used
1. Multinomial Naive Bayes Classification: This algorithm is well-suited for text classification tasks and is commonly used in sentiment analysis. It calculates the probability of a tweet belonging to a specific sentiment class based on the occurrence of words in the text.
2. Random Forest Classification: Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It is effective for handling large datasets and offers good accuracy in classification tasks.
3. KNN Classification: K-Nearest Neighbors is a non-parametric algorithm that classifies data based on its proximity to other data points. In this project, it is used to classify tweets based on the sentiment of the nearest neighbors.

## Usage
To run the Sentiment Analysis for COVID Tweets project, follow these steps:
1. Open the provided Colab notebook [here](link_to_colab_notebook).
2. Make a copy of the notebook to your Google Drive.
3. Upload the dataset Excel sheet to your Google Drive and update the file path in the notebook.
4. Execute the notebook cells to train the classification models and perform sentiment analysis on new tweets.
